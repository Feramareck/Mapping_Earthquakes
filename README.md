# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of the analysis:
The objective of this project was to add two more overlays to the map that already presented all earthquakes: location of tectonic plates on Earth and all earthquakes with magnitude greater than 4.5.  
A third map called Outdoors was also added for better visualization.  
Below is the image of the final result of the project.

All the commented codes that generated the map above are available in the folder Earthquake_Challenge.
